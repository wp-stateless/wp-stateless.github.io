Upload and serve your WordPress media from Google Cloud Storage (GCS) with the WP-Stateless plugin. In as little as two minutes, you will be benefitting from serving your media from Google Cloud’s distributed servers.

New to Google Cloud? Google is offering you a [$300 credit](https://cloud.google.com/free/) to get you started.

### Benefits

* Store and deliver media files on Google Cloud Storage instead of your server.
* Google Cloud Storage is geo-redundant, meaning your media is delivered by the closest server – reducing latency and improving page speed.
* Scale your WordPress website across multiple servers without the need of synchronizing media files.
* Native integration between Google Cloud Storage and WordPress.
* $300 free trial from Google Cloud. Nice!

### Modes

* Backup – Upload media files to Google Storage and serve local file urls.
* CDN – Copy media files to Google Storage and serve them directly from there.
* Stateless – Store and serve media files with Google Cloud Storage only. Media files are not stored locally.

### Features

* Setup assistant makes getting started fast and easy.
* No need to manually create service accounts or buckets – handled automatically.
* Settings panel provides you with further GCS configuration and file url customization.
* Mask the default GCS URL with your own custom domain.
* Automatically replace hardcoded media URLs with GCS equivalents in post editor and meta.
* Batch image thumbnail regeneration.
* Synchronization tools for uploading existing files and images.
* All settings supported with wp-config constants and network setting overrides.
* Multiple modes: Backup, CDN, Stateless.
